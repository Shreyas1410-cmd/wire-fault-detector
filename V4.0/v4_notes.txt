v4.0 Notes - Auto Baseline Detection + No Threshold
---------------------------------------------------
âœ… What's New:
- Baseline is automatically calculated at startup (no threshold needed)
- Detects wire cut when value drops below 85% of baseline
- LED stays ON during alert, blinks otherwise
- Buzzer beeps rapidly during alert phase
- Auto reset after 10 seconds

ðŸ›  Issues Faced:
- Sudden environment changes caused false detection â†’ solution: delay baseline computation
- Needed more smoothing â†’ used 5 samples

ðŸ“Œ Ideas for Next Version:
- Continuously adjust baseline over time (adaptive)
- Store logs to SD card or send via Bluetooth
- Add display (OLED/LCD) to show live data
