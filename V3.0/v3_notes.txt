------------------------------------------------
âœ… What's New:
- Added external buzzer on pin 8
- Smoothed detection using 3 readings
- Auto-reset after 10 seconds
- Serial output made readable with 300ms delay

ðŸ›  Issues Faced:
- COM Port 'Access Denied' issues (solved by checking port conflicts)
- Some instability in sensor data (improved with smoothing)
- Buzzer initially didn't work (solved by testing with basic sketch)

ðŸ“Œ Next Step:
- Self-adjusting threshold (auto-calibrated baseline)
- Logging values to SD card or sending via Bluetooth
