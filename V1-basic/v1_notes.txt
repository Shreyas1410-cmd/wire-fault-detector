v1.0 Notes - Initial Setup
---------------------------
âœ… What was done:
- Connected Hall Effect Sensor (A3144) to A1
- Read analog values and printed them to Serial Monitor

ðŸ›  Issues Faced:
- Readings were updating too fast to read clearly
- No indication via LED or Buzzer
- Had to manually observe for drops in values

ðŸ“Œ Next Step:
- Add LED for basic visual indication
- Add delay or smoothing
