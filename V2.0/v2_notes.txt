v2.0 Notes - Visual Cut Detection via LED
-----------------------------------------
âœ… What was done:
- Used Arduinoâ€™s internal LED (pin 13) as a basic indicator
- Blinked slowly during normal readings
- Kept LED ON constantly when value fell below threshold

ðŸ›  Issues Faced:
- Still dependent on fixed threshold (650)
- Serial monitor updates a bit fast
- Cut detection not very accurate (just based on one value)

ðŸ“Œ Next Step:
- Add buzzer for stronger alert
- Smoothen detection with multiple readings
